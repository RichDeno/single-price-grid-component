Front-end Style Guide
Welcome to my Front-end Style Guide! This guide outlines the key design specifications and guidelines for my web projects.

Layout
My designs are crafted with a focus on responsive layouts to provide the best user experience across various devices. Here are the primary layout widths:

Mobile: 375px
Desktop: 1440px
Colors
Primary Colors
My primary colors are the foundation of my brand identity:

Cyan: This vibrant color is represented as hsl(179, 62%, 43%). It adds a fresh and modern touch to my designs.
Bright Yellow: I used a bold and eye-catching shade of yellow, hsl(71, 73%, 54%), to accentuate key elements.
Neutral Colors
Neutrals provide balance and readability to my content:

Light Gray: my light gray shade, hsl(204, 43%, 93%), is perfect for backgrounds and subtle accents.
Grayish Blue: For secondary elements, I used hsl(218, 22%, 67%), a soft and calming grayish blue.
Typography
Body Copy
Consistency in typography is essential for readability. Here are the body copy specifications:

Font Size: I used a comfortable font size of 16px for body text to ensure content is easily legible.
Font
My chosen font family is Karla, available from Google Fonts. It offers a clean and modern look, enhancing the overall aesthetics of our projects. I utilized two font weights:

400 (Regular): This is my standard font weight for most textual content.
700 (Bold): I employed the bold variant for headings and elements that require emphasis.
Feel free to refer to this guide when working on our front-end projects to maintain a consistent and visually appealing design. If you have any questions or need further clarification, please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out to the design team.
